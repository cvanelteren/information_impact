# Statistical design
The current plan is to apply some kind of non-parametric method; specifically a chi-square distribution check of equal proportions. The question is whether we take the marginals across the conditions or decompose along the temperature ratios. The problem with the latter may be the interperability of the results.


# Random graphs 
Results from the random graphs are not stable. Namely, the results seems tto be biased for undirected unitary weight when sampled symmetrically both positive and negative side of the magnetization. Conversely, when only one part of the magnetization is sample we biased in the inverse direction. The fact is due to the way the Ising dynamics function.

I don't have a solution for this... either way is wrong in my opinion or atleast biased

# Random observations

- The cause of the prediction accuracy is different for the structural metrics versus the informational impact. Namely, informational impact loses performance not due the a wrong hypothesis rather, it is due to a lack of resolution. In contrast, the structural metrics seems to work alright only when the dynamics are congruent, specifically the noise levels. For higher temperatures it tends to become more dependent on the Markov blankets.
