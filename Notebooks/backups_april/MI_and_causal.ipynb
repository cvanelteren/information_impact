    "In order to show the relation between causal influence and mutual information, consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$, where $X$ is said to be causally sufficient for $Y$ if there exists a $x \\in X$ for which there is a change in $Y$. Please note that can only occur if there is a direct relation between $X$ and $Y$, i.e. $X$ and $Y$ form a Markov chain:\n",

Alternatively, one can interpret the do-operator as affecting the strength of the arrow; in the extreme case this would result in a removal of the arrow, i.e. $P(Y | do(X)) = P(Y)$.\n",

    "A change in the distribution of $X$ will have an effect on the distribution of $Y$. Therefore, we can quantify the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ by how much the distribution of $Y$ differs for each $x \\in X$. The difference between $P(Y | do(X)) = P(Y) $ and $P(Y | \\neg do(X)) = P(Y | X)$ can be captured by the Kullback-Leiber divergence of $P(Y | X )$ and $P(Y)$\n"
