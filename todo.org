  There is some work to do on the data. Preferably we want data to have a
  little more trials so that the statistics will be easier. Currently,
  implementation is written for extracting the driver-nodes but looks odd.
  Still left to do:
  - Test the driver-node method
  - Obtain results for more samlpes?
