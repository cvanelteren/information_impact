  There is some work to do on the data. Preferably we want data to have a
  little more trials so that the statistics will be easier. Currently,
  implementation is written for extracting the driver-nodes but looks odd.
  Still left to do:
  - Test the driver-node method
  - Obtain results for more samlpes?
  

* Code cleanup
The import shananingans needs to be looked at carefully. Currently it is getting really messy how the import with submodules work. Preferably I would not need to redefine a bunch of standard imports everytime I need them in files. These include
- Cython
- numpy
- Other generaly functions, e.g. cosine etc


In addition figure out the discrepancy between Ising and Potts model.
