# Introduction

Information toolbox for analyzing complex dynamical systems. The goal of the packages is to provide a general and fast framework for computational scientists to use in addition to providing methods to compute informational impact. The package was written as part of my master thesis and the accompaning paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06654).
